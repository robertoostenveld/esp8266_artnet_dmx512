 *
 * This class subclasses the generic BitArray and initializes its buffer
 * such that it contains a valid DMX(512) universe signal data representation.
 * It provides then a method to set the value of every DMX channel in this
 * buffer at the correct position.
 *
 * This buffer can then be sent via e.g. I2S to a DMX line.
 * Values which the DMX standard does not specify strict defaults for,
 * can be freely configured e.g. the lengths of the various breaks,
 * number of stop bits etc.
 *
 * These parameters can also be changes at runtime which might be useful to
 * find a working configuration for fixtures that do not work nicely with
 * the DMX defaults.
